    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Media has a big impact in our lives and mental health. Studies show us that toxic behaviour and also cyberbullyng can affect directly in our mood, possibly creating conditions that can contribute for some specific sintoms of depression, anxiety and other deseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays it is possible to see that through these platforms (like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook and others), we can also know more about the person that is behind the screen and detect, by the language, if this person might be suffering from depression or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project we intend to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect posts and comments with depressive content in order to help people to improve their emotional and mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset that will be used in this model contain posts of Reddit, collected from Dec 16, 2008 until Jan 2, using Pushshift API. The dataset assumes posts collected from 'SuicideWatch' (an intensive monitoring process used to ensure that any person cannot attempt suicide - https://reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/) contains suicide related content. Similarly we have other classes 'depression' (https://reddit.com/r/depression/) and 'teenagers' (https://reddit.com/r/teenagers/) collected from respective subreddits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target column (class) detects if the post is \"depressive\" (1) or \"not-depressive\" (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 232.074 rows \n",
    "- 3 columns \n",
    "- 1 text column\n",
    "- 2 numeric columns \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strutcture of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- EDA of the influence of Social Media in the mood and mental health of people, using a Dataset from ScienceDirect, a website which provides access to a large bibliographic database of scientific and medical publications of the Dutch publisher Elsevier.\n",

    "Most language processing systems need to recognize and interpret the linguistic structures that exist in a sequence of words. This task is virtually impossible if all we know about each word is its textual representation. The process of classifying words in this sense, and tagging them accordingly, is known as discourse-part tagging (or 'grammatical class tagging'). This process will help the machine to better 'interpret' the context of texts. The set of tags used for a particular task is known as a tag set."

    "## Naive Bayes Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to make calculations. We can use whatever method we want, but we will try to use the Naive Bayes Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is really easy to understand and to use. This theorem is about conditional probabilities: **what is the probability to find a result given something else is known?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix ideas, let's consider only two features $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. We can ask what is the probability to find them together? ie\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{1},x_{2}) = ?$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As this can be complicated, we can split the process in two:\n",
    "\n",
    "* compute the probability of finding one of the features values\n",
    "\n",
    "* once we have the first one, compute the probability to find the second one, given the first\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{1},x_{2}) = P(x_{1})*P(x_{2}|x_{1}) \\tag{1}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(x_{2}|x_{1})$ is the probability that having x_{1} finding x_{2}. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could also have started finding first $x_{2}$ and then, $x_{1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{1},x_{2}) = P(x_{2})*P(x_{1}|x_{2}) \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The left hand side of equations (1) and (2) is the same, therefore, que can equal the right hand sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{1})*P(x_{2}|x_{1}) = P(x_{2})*P(x_{1}|x_{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can isolate on of the both conditional probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{2}|x_{1})=\\frac{P(x_{2})*P(x_{1}|x_{2})}{P(x_{1})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or similarly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_{1}|x_{2})=\\frac{P(x_{1})*P(x_{2}|x_{1})}{P(x_{2})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the Bayes theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is telling us? It tells us that if we want to compute a conditional probability which is difficult to compute, we can compute it using the conditional probability with the features in reverse order and the individual probabilitites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What the Bayes Theorem has to do with review ratings? Easy, we can consider the independent features of our dataframe as one big feature: $X$ and the dependent feature ( rating ) as the other $R$. Then we want to compute what is the probability to obtain a given rating, given $X$. In other words, we are looking for $P(R|X)$. But now, we know the Bayes Theorem and we can compute this probability for every review as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(R|X) = \\frac{P(R)*P(X|R)}{P(X)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to compute each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(R)$ is the probability of finding a given rating R in our dataset: pretty easy!!! (number of reviews with a given rating out of total)\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X)$ is the probability to find a review with a given set of features: also pretty easy!!! (number of reviews with a given set of features out of total)\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X|R)$ this is the probability of finding a given features in the review AMONG the ratings R. In other words, within all the reviews with a given rating R, how many of them have the given features out of total number of revires with rating R\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically this is filtering and counting. Of course this method will not be too accurate if our sampling is poor. Let's give it a try anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat!\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Bayes Theorem, we need to divide by $P(X)$. This can become a problem if our dataset is too small, because then the probability of finding a review which has exactly the same values in the same columns can be null, and therefore the conditional probability will blow up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a function to do this for us."
